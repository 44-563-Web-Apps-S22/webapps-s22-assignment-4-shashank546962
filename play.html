        <h3>Tartuffe  or The Hypocrite</h3>
        <h4>ACT IV -  SCENE I  Cleante, Tartuffe</h4>
        <p>Cleante.  Yes, the whole town is talking about it,
            And they don't think it does you much credit.
            And I've sought you out, sir, just for the sake
            Of telling you bluntly what I think's at stake.
            I'm not going to dredge up the whole dispute;
            The fact is Damis is in disrepute.
            Supposing that he did act like a fool
            And that you are unfairly being called cruel,
            Shouldn't a Christian pardon the offense
            And purge his soul of desire for vengeance?
            And should you permit him, for this one goof,
            To be driven away from his father's roof?
            I'll tell you again, and I'll be bold:
            You are scandalizing both young and old.
            If you take my advice, you will seek a truce
            And not be a party to this boy's abuse.
            Make an offering to God of your acrimony,
            And restore the son to his patrimony.
    Tartuffe.  Alas!  As for myself, I seek that solace:
            I do not have for him the slightest malice;
            I wholly forgive him of any blame,
            And long to restore him to his good name.
            But in the service of God I can't permit
             It, for if he remains I shall have to quit
            This house.  No prior offense holds a candle
            To his.  Our meeting would cause a huge scandal.
            Lord only knows what people would assume!
            They would impute it to cunning, I presume,
            And say that my guilt has made me pretend
            To excuse him of any intent to offend,
            And that I fear him and wish to placate him
            As a crafty move in my plan to checkmate him.
    Cleante.  I think you are making up excuses,
            And your arguments, monsieur, seem like ruses.
            Must you assume the role of the Deity?
            Does He need us to punish the guilty?
            Leave it to Him to take care of vengeance;
            He bids us to forgive every offense
            And not to consider human judgments
            When we follow God's sovereign commandments.
            What?  Should the petty fear of what some may say
            Prevent you from doing this good deed today?
            No, let us always follow God's commands,
            And leave all other matters in His hands.
    Tartuffe.  I've told you already that I forgive
            Him, and that, sir, is God's directive.
            But after such scandal and vituperation
            God doesn't demand our cohabitation.
    Cleante.  And does He demand that you lend your hand
            To the pure caprice of the father's command,
            And accept the gift of his whole estate
            Which you cannot justly appropriate?
    Tartuffe.  Those who know me will not believe that I'd
            Do anything selfish or unjustified.
            I hold worldly goods in quite low esteem.
            I can't be dazzled by their phony gleam.
            And if in the end I decide to take
            The gift that the father wishes to make,
            It is only, I swear, because I fear
            That it could be left to a false profiteer,
            Or that it could be shared by those who would
            Use it to do evil rather than good,
            And who would not use it, as I'm sure I can,
            For the glory of God and one's fellow man.
    Cleante.  Oh, sir!  Don't put on that scrupulous air
            While your actions injure a rightful heir.
            Don't feel uneasy or risk your good health
            By fretting about the perils of his wealth.
            It is better spent on a young man's whim
            Than that you be accused of defrauding him.
            I only wonder why you aren't ashamed
            By this proposal in which you are named.
            In true religion is there some dictum
            That says it's okay to make an heir your victim?
            And if God has put some obstacle in place
            Against you and Damis sharing the same space,
            Wouldn't you prefer to be more discrete
            And leave this house in a noble retreat
            Than to sit and see the son of the house
            Thrust from his home like a beggarly louse.
            Believe me, it would prove your probity,
            Monsieur, . . .
    Tartuffe.     It is now, Monsieur, half past three:
            Certain religious rites demand my presence,
            And you must excuse me for my absence. [He leaves.]
    Cleante.  Ah!
    
    SCENE II
    Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Cleante
    
    Dorine [to Cleante].  Please, sir, help us help her, for pity's sake.
            Her suffering is such that her heart may break,
            And the pact her father made this evening
            Is the cause of all this awful grieving.
            Here he comes.  Let's join forces, I beg you,
            And try through skill or cunning to undo
            The vicious scheme that's left us all so troubled.
    
    Scene 3
    Orgon, Elmire, Mariane, Cleante, Dorine
    
    Orgon.  Ah!  I'm pleased to see you all assembled.
            [To Mariane]  This contract here should make you very gay;
            I'm sure you know what I'm about to say.
    Mariane [kneeling].  In the name of God, who knows how I hurt,
            And of everything which might move your heart,
            Forgo, for now, the rights of paternity
            And release me from my vow of docility.
            Do not reduce me by some brutal rule
            To asking God why you've grown so cruel.
            And this life, alas, that you gave to me--
            Do not make it a life of misery.
            If, contrary to all my sweet hopes of
            Joy, you forbid me to wed the man I love,
            Hear me at least--on my knees I implore
            You not to give me to a man I abhor,
            And don't push me past the point of despair
            By using your full force in this affair.
    Orgon [to himself, sensing himself weakening].  Be firm.  This is no time for humanity!
    Mariane.  Your fondness for him doesn't bother me.
            Indulge it, and if it's not enough to consign
            Your whole estate to him--then give him mine!
            I freely consent and will sign on demand,
            But please, please, do not offer him my hand,
            And allow me to live in a convent where I
            May count the sad days till God lets me die.
    Orgon.  Young girls always play such religious pranks
            When their fathers hobble their lusty flanks!
            Get up!  The harder you have to work to bear it,
            The greater the virtue and the merit.
            Let this marriage mortify your senses
            And quit bothering me with your meek defenses.
    Dorine.  But . . .
    Orgon.        Keep quiet, and stay out of this matter.
            I completely forbid you to add to the chatter.
    Cleante.  If you will allow me to offer some advice . . .
    Orgon.  Brother, your advice is worth any price:
            It is thoughtful and I truly respect it,
            But I hope you don't mind if I reject it.
    Elmire [to her husband].  What can I think about what you're saying
            Except that your blindness is quite dismaying!
            You must be besotted and led astray
            To refuse to believe what has happened today.
    Orgon.  My dear, I only call 'em as I see 'em.
            You favor my son, that worthless young bum,
            And I think that you are afraid to condemn
            His dirty trick on this most saintly of men.
            You are, in fact, too calm to be believed;
            You ought to have seemed a bit more aggrieved.
    Elmire.  When a love-sick man makes a foolish mistake
            Must we take up arms as if honor's at stake?
            And should we always respond to small slips
            With fire in our eyes and abuse on our lips?
            For myself, I laugh at these signs of lust;
            It doesn't please me at all to grow nonplussed.
            I seek wisdom tempered with charity,
            And I'm not one of those prudes whose asperity
            Is such that they fight for virtue tooth and nail,
            And scratch a man's eyes out for being male.
            Heaven preserve me from that kind of virtue!
            I am an honest wife, but not a shrew,
            And I believe that a calm, icy glance
            Is quite enough to rebuff an advance.
    Orgon.  I know what I know and I won't change my mind.
    Elmire.  I'm again amazed that you could be so blind.
            But would you keep that incredulity
            If I made you see that we have spoken truly?
    Orgon.  See?
    Elmire.       Yes.
    Orgon.             Fantasy!
    Elmire.                       But if I found a way
            To make you see it all in light of day?</p>
