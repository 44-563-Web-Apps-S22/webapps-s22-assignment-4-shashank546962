            ACT IV
            SCENE I
            Cleante, Tartuffe</h3></p>
        <p><h4>Cleante.</h4>  Yes, the whole town is talking about it,
            And they don't think it does you much credit.
            And I've sought you out, sir, just for the sake
            Of telling you bluntly what I think's at stake.
            I'm not going to dredge up the whole dispute;
            The fact is Damis is in disrepute.
            Supposing that he did act like a fool
            And that you are unfairly being called cruel,
            Shouldn't a Christian pardon the offense
            And purge his soul of desire for vengeance?
            And should you permit him, for this one goof,
            To be driven away from his father's roof?
            I'll tell you again, and I'll be bold:
            You are scandalizing both young and old.
            If you take my advice, you will seek a truce
            And not be a party to this boy's abuse.
            Make an offering to God of your acrimony,
            And restore the son to his patrimony.</p>
   <p><h4>Tartuffe.</h4>  Alas!  As for myself, I seek that solace:
            I do not have for him the slightest malice;
            I wholly forgive him of any blame,
            And long to restore him to his good name.
            But in the service of God I can't permit
             It, for if he remains I shall have to quit
            This house.  No prior offense holds a candle
            To his.  Our meeting would cause a huge scandal.
            Lord only knows what people would assume!
            They would impute it to cunning, I presume,
            And say that my guilt has made me pretend
            To excuse him of any intent to offend,
            And that I fear him and wish to placate him
            As a crafty move in my plan to checkmate him.</p>
   <p><h4>Cleante.</h4>  I think you are making up excuses,
            And your arguments, monsieur, seem like ruses.
            Must you assume the role of the Deity?
            Does He need us to punish the guilty?
            Leave it to Him to take care of vengeance;
            He bids us to forgive every offense
            And not to consider human judgments
            When we follow God's sovereign commandments.
            What?  Should the petty fear of what some may say
            Prevent you from doing this good deed today?
            No, let us always follow God's commands,
            And leave all other matters in His hands.</p>
  <p><h4>Tartuffe.</h4>  I've told you already that I forgive
            Him, and that, sir, is God's directive.
            But after such scandal and vituperation
            God doesn't demand our cohabitation.</p>
   <p><h4>Cleante.</h4>  And does He demand that you lend your hand
            To the pure caprice of the father's command,
            And accept the gift of his whole estate
            Which you cannot justly appropriate?</p>
  <p><h4>Tartuffe.</h4>  Those who know me will not believe that I'd
            Do anything selfish or unjustified.
            I hold worldly goods in quite low esteem.
            I can't be dazzled by their phony gleam.
            And if in the end I decide to take
            The gift that the father wishes to make,
            It is only, I swear, because I fear
            That it could be left to a false profiteer,
            Or that it could be shared by those who would
            Use it to do evil rather than good,
            And who would not use it, as I'm sure I can,
            For the glory of God and one's fellow man.</p>
   <p><h4>Cleante.</h4>  Oh, sir!  Don't put on that scrupulous air
            While your actions injure a rightful heir.
            Don't feel uneasy or risk your good health
            By fretting about the perils of his wealth.
            It is better spent on a young man's whim
            Than that you be accused of defrauding him.
            I only wonder why you aren't ashamed
            By this proposal in which you are named.
            In true religion is there some dictum
            That says it's okay to make an heir your victim?
            And if God has put some obstacle in place
            Against you and Damis sharing the same space,
            Wouldn't you prefer to be more discrete
            And leave this house in a noble retreat
            Than to sit and see the son of the house
            Thrust from his home like a beggarly louse.
            Believe me, it would prove your probity,
            Monsieur, . . .</p>
  <p><h4>Tartuffe.</h4>    It is now, Monsieur, half past three:
            Certain religious rites demand my presence,
            And you must excuse me for my absence. [He leaves.]</p>
   <p><h4>Cleante.</h4>  Ah!</p></p>
